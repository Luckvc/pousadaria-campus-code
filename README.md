## Introduction
Project developed as part of TreinaDev 11 at Campus Code, with a focus on Test-Driven Development using Ruby on Rails.

The application is divided into two main features: one designed for inn owners, providing tools for efficient management of their establishments. The other tailored for user clients, allowing them to search, view details about inns and their rooms, check availability, and make room reservations.
